# PROJECT_STRUCTURE Template — Data pipeline / scraper + reports

Repo layout for an ingestion and report-delivery system. Adapt to chosen runtime (Python is common, Node also fine).

Target length: 200–300 lines.

## pipelines/{pipeline-name}/

\`\`\`
[tree showing one example pipeline's files]
\`\`\`

### Pipeline conventions

- One folder per source or tightly-coupled source group.
- Each pipeline is callable as a single entrypoint (`python -m pipelines.X.pipeline --window=...`).
- Stages are functions, not classes by default (simpler, easier to test, easier to compose).
- Each stage takes typed input and returns typed output (TypedDict / Pydantic / TypeScript types).
- No global state. Configuration flows in via parameters.

## shared/http/ — Fetch infrastructure

\`\`\`
[tree — client wrappers, retry logic, rate limiter]
\`\`\`

### HTTP conventions

- App code never calls `requests`/`fetch` directly. Always go through wrapper.
- Wrapper adds: retry, exponential backoff, rate limiting, observability hooks.
- Rate limits are per-host, configurable per source.

## shared/proxy/ — Proxy rotation (if scraping)

\`\`\`
[tree — proxy pool client, session management, captcha integration]
\`\`\`

### Proxy conventions

- One proxy provider integration per file. Easy to swap/add providers.
- Failed proxies are quarantined for N minutes before retry.

## shared/storage/

\`\`\`
[tree — raw_storage.py, staging.py, final.py]
\`\`\`

### Storage conventions

- Path convention is centralized: `raw/{source}/{YYYYMMDD}/{run_id}/{filename}`.
- Atomic writes: write to temp path, rename on success.
- All storage operations log: bytes, target path, duration.

## shared/quality/

\`\`\`
[tree — schema validators, stats checks, anomaly detection]
\`\`\`

### Quality conventions

- Validation is pluggable per pipeline.
- Failures route to quarantine zone; runs do not silently drop records.
- Statistical checks use a baseline file per pipeline (rolling window of historical metrics).

## shared/delivery/

\`\`\`
[tree — PDF generator, email sender, CSV builder, webhook poster]
\`\`\`

### Delivery conventions

- Templates live in `reports/`, separate from delivery code.
- Personalization is parameterized at delivery boundary; templates are pure.
- Failed deliveries log to a delivery_log table with retry capability.

## reports/

\`\`\`
[tree — Jinja or HTML templates, asset folders]
\`\`\`

## orchestrator/

\`\`\`
[tree — DAG files, schedule config, environment-specific overrides]
\`\`\`

### Orchestration conventions

- DAG definitions live separately from pipeline code. The pipeline is invokable standalone for testing.
- Schedule is explicit (cron expressions or interval), with timezone declared.
- Concurrency limits per DAG to prevent overlap.
- Backfill is supported via parameterized run window.

## Coding Conventions

### Language-specific
- [Python: type hints required, Pydantic for I/O, ruff/black, virtualenv pinned in pyproject.toml]
- [Node: TypeScript strict, Zod for I/O, pnpm/npm pinned]

### Pipeline ergonomics
- Pipelines are runnable locally with a small fixture (`data/fixtures/`).
- A `--dry-run` flag suppresses external writes (storage, delivery) for testing.
- A `--window` parameter accepts ISO date or interval for backfill.

### Idempotency
- Same input window → same output state. Always.
- Use deterministic IDs (hashes) where natural keys are absent.

### Testing
- Unit tests for each stage with fixtures.
- Integration tests run a full pipeline end-to-end against a local-only target.
- Quality checks are tested with both passing and failing fixtures.

### Observability
- Every stage logs: stage name, run_id, input count, output count, duration.
- A run summary at the end posts to the chosen alerting surface (Slack/email/etc).

### Commits & Branches
- [conventional commits, branch naming]

### Environment Variables
- Source secrets: per-source API keys, scraping API tokens.
- Storage: cloud bucket names, credentials.
- Delivery: SMTP, webhook URLs.

## Writing tips

- **Pipelines as folders, not classes.** Easier to scan, easier to evolve.
- **Stages as functions.** Composition is testing's friend.
- **Idempotency is non-negotiable.** Re-runs must be safe.
- **Quality checks are part of the pipeline, not optional.** Without them, the pipeline rots silently.
