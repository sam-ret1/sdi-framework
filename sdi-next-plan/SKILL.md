description: Generate the next IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md for an ongoing project after a previous work item closes. Reads the current state of the repo (AGENTS, DECISIONS, MEMORY, ROADMAP, prior plan) and produces one new plan tailored to the next work item. USE when "phase X closed, plan the next", "scope feature Y", "plan maintenance for Z", "what's the next implementation plan?". DO NOT USE for initial product scoping (use mvp-architect), reviewing in-flight work (use sdi-review), or executing the plan (use sdi-mode).

# sdi-next-plan

This skill generates the next `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` for an ongoing project. It runs after the user finishes a work item (or phase) and wants to plan the next one.

## What this is not

- **Not the initial bundle.** Initial scoping (PRD, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, etc.) is `mvp-architect` Phase 0–C. This skill assumes those exist.
- **Not a review.** If the user wants a second pair of eyes on a plan or round, that's `sdi-review`.
- **Not implementation.** Execution is `sdi-mode`.

## When to enter

**Strong signals — proactive offer or user-initiated:**

- The current `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*` has had its end-of-phase housekeeping done (per sdi-mode Step 8): all gates green, AC mapped to evidence, AGENTS.md tracker updated.
- The user says: "phase X closed — let's plan the next", "what's the next plan?", "let's scope feature [Y]", "let's plan maintenance for [W]".
- ROADMAP.md indicates the next phase and its pre-requisites are met.

**Soft signals — verify with user first:**

- A round (not full phase) just closed and the user is clearly thinking ahead about the next phase.
- The user shows a memory entry that mentions next-phase pre-work.

**Don't enter if:**

- The current work item is mid-flight (incomplete rounds, pending blockers). Use `sdi-review` instead.
- The user is asking for review of the current plan, not generation of the next. Use `sdi-review`.
- The project is so early there's no `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*` closed yet — that's still mvp-architect Phase C territory.

## How it works

1. **Read the current state of the repo** (NOT memory of earlier conversations). Detailed reading order in `references/next-phase-planning.md` §"Reading order before generating".
2. **Calibrate** against ROADMAP with ≤4 focused questions.
3. **Light discovery** only on what's specific to this work item — do NOT re-run mvp-architect Phase A.
4. **Generate one new `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`** using the universal template + type appendix.
5. **Update AGENTS.md work tracker** with the new row.
6. **Optional:** ROADMAP revision note if subsequent phases shifted.
7. **Hand off to `sdi-mode`** via the kickoff prompt.

## Naming choice

| Use `PHASE_N` | Use `<slug>` |
|---|---|
| Project follows a discrete linear ROADMAP (greenfield, structured migrations) | Free-form feature work, bugfixes, maintenance batches, perf passes |
| The work item maps cleanly to "next phase" in ROADMAP | The work item is one of many concurrent or unordered streams |
| User started with `mvp-architect` Phase 0–C | User started with `convert-to-sdi` (legacy adoption) or has been using slugs |
| Examples: `PHASE_2`, `PHASE_3` | Examples: `billing-portal`, `q1-perf-pass`, `customer-x-bugfix`, `auth-refactor` |

The framework treats `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` uniformly — both styles work. Pick what fits the project's mental model.

## Common failure modes

- **Re-running Phase A.** Tempting to "verify the universal themes again" — don't. mvp-architect Phase 0/A/B/C established type, modifier, stack, scope, conventions. This skill only asks about what's specific to the next work item.
- **Generating plan divorced from current repo state.** If you skip the reading order (especially DECISIONS and recent memory), the plan ignores constraints already established. Always read first.
- **Speculating about phase N+2.** The plan is for the **next** work item, not the one after that. Future phases stay in ROADMAP, not in the next plan.
- **Ignoring DECISIONS already taken.** A DECISIONS entry that says "we use approach X for [area]" is binding — the next plan must follow it or explicitly supersede with a new entry. Never silently ignore.
