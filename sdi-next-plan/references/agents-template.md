# AGENTS.md template (project facts only)

This is the canonical template the skill uses to update the project's `AGENTS.md` work tracker after a new `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` is generated. The skill does not regenerate `AGENTS.md` from scratch (that's `mvp-architect` Phase C or `convert-to-sdi` Phase 2) — it only adds a row to the work tracker.

Keep this template in sync with the equivalent files in `mvp-architect/references/agents-template.md` and `convert-to-sdi/references/agents-template.md`. All three skills carry their own copy on purpose: each skill is self-contained so it can run on platforms without the full framework cloned locally.

The template generates a **fact sheet** for the SDI workflow. Discipline rules (audit, checkpoints, tone, document precedence) live in the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or the configured custom mode (Roo / Kilo / OpenCode), not in `AGENTS.md`. When generating, never inject behavioral instructions into `AGENTS.md`.

## Template — copy everything below this line into the project's `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

> Project-specific **fact sheet** for the SDI workflow. Read by Codex natively at the start of every session and imported by Claude Code via `CLAUDE.md`.
>
> **Edit only project facts** (stack, doc map, conventions, work tracker).
> **Never inject discipline rules** (audit steps, checkpoint behavior, tone, document precedence) — those live in the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or custom mode (Roo Code / Kilo Code / OpenCode) and propagate from there.
>
> - **Fact** → "DECISIONS.md lives at `docs/DECISIONS.md`", "Test runner: vitest", "Auth helpers in `src/lib/auth/`".
> - **Instruction** (do **not** put here) → "When you make a non-obvious choice, append to DECISIONS.md", "Stop at checkpoints", "Audit before coding".

## Operating context

This project follows the SDI (Spec-Driven Implementation) workflow. The implementation discipline is loaded from the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or the configured `sdi-mode` custom mode (Roo Code / Kilo Code / OpenCode). This file carries only the project-specific facts the agent needs in every session.

For the discipline itself (8-step loop, audit-first protocol, stop-and-review checkpoints, document precedence, tone, references), invoke / activate `sdi-mode`.

## Project context

- **Type:** [filled by `mvp-architect` Phase 0 — e.g., "Web app SaaS multi-tenant"]
- **AI/LLM modifier:** [yes / no — if yes, also see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` AI sections and operate under AI guardrails]
- **Stack:** [filled during/after planning — e.g., "Next.js 15 App Router + Drizzle + Postgres + Supabase Auth + Inngest"]
- **Primary deployment target:** [Vercel / Fly / Railway / EAS / etc.]

## Document map

All planning docs live under `docs/` unless noted:

- `docs/README.md` — index
- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — stack + type-specific structural model + critical flows + trade-offs
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phased delivery
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` — repo layout and conventions
- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — visual language *(only if UI exists)*
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` — detailed spec for the current work item. `PHASE_N` for discrete phases (greenfield/migrations); `<slug>` for free-form work (features, maintenance) in ongoing projects.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — running paper trail of non-obvious choices *(append-only, atemporal)*
- `docs/MEMORY.md` — index of daily memory entries
- `docs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily session memory: active round, blockers, next step, open questions

## Project-specific conventions

*Populated as the agent discovers them during audit and implementation. The agent proposes additions; the user approves before they land.*

### Stack details

- [e.g., "Auth helpers: `requireRole()` and `requireRoleApi()` in `src/lib/auth/session.ts`"]
- [e.g., "Schema directory: `drizzle/`, with migrations named `NNNN_description.sql`"]
- [e.g., "Test runners: `vitest` for unit (in `*.test.ts`), `vitest --config integration.config.ts` for integration"]

### File / directory conventions

- [e.g., "API routes: `src/app/api/<resource>/route.ts`, never directly fetch in components"]
- [e.g., "Domain logic: `src/lib/<domain>/`; never in route handlers"]

### Convention exceptions

- [e.g., "`src/legacy/` follows older patterns — don't touch unless explicitly scoped in a phase"]

## Work tracker

| Work item | Type | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 (scaffolding) | phase | [pending / ✓] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [link to round report or commit range] |
| Phase 1 | phase | [pending / in progress / ✓] | | |
| ... | | | | |

`Type` accepts: `phase` (discrete numbered phases — greenfield, migrations) | `feature` | `maintenance` | `migration` | `refactor` | `perf` | `bugfix`. `Work item` accepts `Phase N` or a slug (e.g. `billing-portal`, `q1-perf-pass`). Each row corresponds to one `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`.

## Updating this file

This file is **living** for project facts only. Every phase reveals new project-specific conventions — add them under the relevant section. Every phase completes — update the work tracker.

Two rules:

1. Edit only project facts. If you find yourself writing behavioral instructions ("the agent should...", "always do X before Y"), stop — that belongs in the `sdi-mode` skill/mode, not here.
2. Propose updates explicitly; don't silently mutate. The user reviews and approves changes.
```

## Companion: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code only)

When generating for a project that targets Claude Code, also create `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root with a single line:

```markdown
@AGENTS.md
```

This makes Claude Code import `AGENTS.md` on every session, the same way Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively. No further content goes in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What this skill fills in

`sdi-next-plan` does not regenerate the full `AGENTS.md` — it only adds a new row to the `Work tracker` section after generating an `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`. The pattern:

```markdown
| billing-portal | feature | pending — plan generated | 2026-04-25 | docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_billing-portal.md |
```

Mark the previous work item as ✓ if it isn't already.

The full template above is included for reference so the skill can recognize the structure when reading `AGENTS.md` and reason about what fields exist.

## Anti-patterns — never do these when updating `AGENTS.md`

- **Do not** copy in any of the SDI discipline (8 steps, the 4 rules, "stop at checkpoints", "audit before coding"). That belongs in `sdi-mode`.
- **Do not** include "you are the implementation agent" or any identity statement. The skill/mode handles identity when active.
- **Do not** include "what this mode is not", "tone", or "document precedence" sections. Those live in `sdi-mode`.
- **Do not** remove the "Edit only project facts" rubric at the top — it is the guardrail that keeps this template clean over time.
