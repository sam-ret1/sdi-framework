# AGENTS.md template (project facts only)

This is the canonical template the skill uses to generate the project's `AGENTS.md` at the end of Phase C (and the same template `convert-to-sdi` uses in Phase 2). The skill copies this content into the new project's repo root, then customizes the placeholders with the project's type, stack, and conventions.

Keep this template in sync with the equivalent file in `convert-to-sdi/references/agents-template.md`. Both skills carry their own copy on purpose: each skill is self-contained so it can run on platforms without the full framework cloned locally.

The template generates a **fact sheet** for the SDI workflow. Discipline rules (audit, checkpoints, tone, document precedence) live in the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or the configured custom mode (Roo / Kilo / OpenCode), not in `AGENTS.md`. When generating, never inject behavioral instructions into `AGENTS.md`.

## Template — copy everything below this line into the project's `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

> Project-specific **fact sheet** for the SDI workflow. Read by Codex natively at the start of every session and imported by Claude Code via `CLAUDE.md`.
>
> **Edit only project facts** (stack, doc map, conventions, work tracker).
> **Never inject discipline rules** (audit steps, checkpoint behavior, tone, document precedence) — those live in the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or custom mode (Roo Code / Kilo Code / OpenCode) and propagate from there.
>
> - **Fact** → "DECISIONS.md lives at `docs/DECISIONS.md`", "Test runner: vitest", "Auth helpers in `src/lib/auth/`".
> - **Instruction** (do **not** put here) → "When you make a non-obvious choice, append to DECISIONS.md", "Stop at checkpoints", "Audit before coding".

## Operating context

This project follows the SDI (Spec-Driven Implementation) workflow. The implementation discipline is loaded from the `sdi-mode` skill (Claude Code / Codex) or the configured `sdi-mode` custom mode (Roo Code / Kilo Code / OpenCode). This file carries only the project-specific facts the agent needs in every session.

For the discipline itself (8-step loop, audit-first protocol, stop-and-review checkpoints, document precedence, tone, references), invoke / activate `sdi-mode`.

## Project context

- **Type:** [filled by `mvp-architect` Phase 0 — e.g., "Web app SaaS multi-tenant"]
- **AI/LLM modifier:** [yes / no — if yes, also see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` AI sections and operate under AI guardrails]
- **Stack:** [filled during/after planning — e.g., "Next.js 15 App Router + Drizzle + Postgres + Supabase Auth + Inngest"]
- **Primary deployment target:** [Vercel / Fly / Railway / EAS / etc.]

## Document map

All planning docs live under `docs/` unless noted:

- `docs/README.md` — index
- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — stack + type-specific structural model + critical flows + trade-offs
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — phased delivery
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` — repo layout and conventions
- `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — visual language *(only if UI exists)*
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` — detailed spec for the current work item. `PHASE_N` for discrete phases (greenfield/migrations); `<slug>` for free-form work (features, maintenance) in ongoing projects.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — running paper trail of non-obvious choices *(append-only, atemporal)*
- `docs/MEMORY.md` — index of daily memory entries
- `docs/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily session memory: active round, blockers, next step, open questions

## Project-specific conventions

*Populated as the agent discovers them during audit and implementation. The agent proposes additions; the user approves before they land.*

### Stack details

- [e.g., "Auth helpers: `requireRole()` and `requireRoleApi()` in `src/lib/auth/session.ts`"]
- [e.g., "Schema directory: `drizzle/`, with migrations named `NNNN_description.sql`"]
- [e.g., "Test runners: `vitest` for unit (in `*.test.ts`), `vitest --config integration.config.ts` for integration"]

### File / directory conventions

- [e.g., "API routes: `src/app/api/<resource>/route.ts`, never directly fetch in components"]
- [e.g., "Domain logic: `src/lib/<domain>/`; never in route handlers"]

### Convention exceptions

- [e.g., "`src/legacy/` follows older patterns — don't touch unless explicitly scoped in a phase"]

## Work tracker

| Work item | Type | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 (scaffolding) | phase | [pending / ✓] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [link to round report or commit range] |
| Phase 1 | phase | [pending / in progress / ✓] | | |
| ... | | | | |

`Type` accepts: `phase` (discrete numbered phases — greenfield, migrations) | `feature` | `maintenance` | `migration` | `refactor` | `perf` | `bugfix`. `Work item` accepts `Phase N` or a slug (e.g. `billing-portal`, `q1-perf-pass`). Each row corresponds to one `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`.

## Updating this file

This file is **living** for project facts only. Every phase reveals new project-specific conventions — add them under the relevant section. Every phase completes — update the work tracker.

Two rules:

1. Edit only project facts. If you find yourself writing behavioral instructions ("the agent should...", "always do X before Y"), stop — that belongs in the `sdi-mode` skill/mode, not here.
2. Propose updates explicitly; don't silently mutate. The user reviews and approves changes.
```

## Companion: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code only)

When generating for a project that targets Claude Code, also create `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root with a single line:

```markdown
@AGENTS.md
```

This makes Claude Code import `AGENTS.md` on every session, the same way Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively. No further content goes in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What to fill in vs leave as placeholder

When `mvp-architect` Phase C generates this:

- **Fill in confidently** (Phase B answers settled them): `Type`, `AI/LLM modifier`, `Primary deployment target`, the high-level `Stack`.
- **Leave as placeholder for the implementation agent to discover**: `Stack details` subsection (specific helper names, schema directories, test runners), `File / directory conventions`, `Convention exceptions`. These are project-specific and emerge during the first audit and rounds. The implementation agent (running under `sdi-mode`) is responsible for proposing additions; the user approves.
- **Leave empty rows in `Work tracker`** beyond the current phase. Each new `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md` adds a row.

When `convert-to-sdi` Phase 2 generates this from an existing repo:

- **Fill in from the auto-audit** (Phase 0): everything detectable — type, stack, deployment target, doc map paths.
- **Fill in from triage answers** (Phase 1): AI modifier flag, project stage notes (informs `Convention exceptions`).
- **Pre-populate `Stack details`** with whatever the audit detected (e.g., test runner detected from package.json scripts).
- **Pre-populate `Work tracker`** with a single retroactive row marking the existing project state ("converted to SDI on YYYY-MM-DD; first work item TBD").

## Anti-patterns — never do these when generating `AGENTS.md`

- **Do not** copy in any of the SDI discipline (8 steps, the 4 rules, "stop at checkpoints", "audit before coding"). That belongs in `sdi-mode`.
- **Do not** include "you are the implementation agent" or any identity statement. The skill/mode handles identity when active.
- **Do not** include "what this mode is not", "tone", or "document precedence" sections. Those live in `sdi-mode`.
- **Do not** remove the "Edit only project facts" rubric at the top — it is the guardrail that keeps this template clean over time.
