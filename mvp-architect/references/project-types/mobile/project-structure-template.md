# PROJECT_STRUCTURE Template — Mobile app

Repo layout for a mobile app. Adapts to chosen framework (React Native/Expo, Flutter, native).

Target length: 200–300 lines.

## Structure

# [Product] — Project Structure & Conventions

> Folder layout and conventions for the [React Native + Expo / Flutter / Native iOS+Android] app. Read by the coding agent as context when generating code.

## src/screens/ — Screens

\`\`\`
[tree — one folder per screen with screen file, child components, hooks specific to the screen]
\`\`\`

### Screen conventions

- One folder per screen: `screens/Home/`, `screens/ProfileEdit/`.
- Each folder contains the screen component, screen-specific hooks, and any sub-components.
- Screen receives navigation props as typed; never imports navigator directly.
- Data fetching uses `src/api/` — no inline fetches.

## src/navigation/ — Routing

\`\`\`
[tree — root navigator, stack/tab definitions, route type definitions]
\`\`\`

### Navigation conventions

- Route types are declared centrally; screens read typed params.
- Deep link route map is colocated with navigator config.
- Modal vs push transitions are explicit per route.

## src/api/ — Network

\`\`\`
[tree — client.ts, endpoints organized by resource]
\`\`\`

### API conventions

- Single client wraps fetch/Apollo. App code never calls fetch directly.
- Wrapper handles: auth header, retry, request id, offline queue.
- Errors are typed (NetworkError, AuthError, ServerError).

## src/stores/ — State

\`\`\`
[tree per store domain]
\`\`\`

### State conventions

- Each store has a clear domain — auth store, settings store, draft store.
- Selectors are exported for reuse; components don't reach into raw state.
- Persisted slices listed explicitly.

## src/persistence/

\`\`\`
[tree — wrappers for AsyncStorage/MMKV/SQLite]
\`\`\`

### Persistence conventions

- App code uses domain methods (`saveDraft`, `loadAuthToken`), not raw KV calls.
- PII (tokens, biometric refs) goes through secure storage (Keychain / Keystore).

## src/notifications/

\`\`\`
[tree — registration, handler, preference UI]
\`\`\`

### Notification conventions

- Permission request is gated by an in-app rationale screen, not auto-prompted on first launch.
- Token registration retries on transient failures; refreshed token re-registers automatically.
- Foreground notification handling renders an in-app toast; background goes to OS surface.

## src/deep-links/

\`\`\`
[tree — parser, route resolver, fallbacks]
\`\`\`

## src/analytics/

\`\`\`
[tree — events.ts (taxonomy), tracker.ts (wrapper)]
\`\`\`

### Analytics conventions

- All events go through `tracker.ts`. No direct SDK calls in components.
- Event names follow a fixed taxonomy file; no ad-hoc strings.
- PII is never in event properties.

## src/theme/

\`\`\`
[tree — tokens, typography, light/dark]
\`\`\`

## Coding Conventions

### Framework idioms
- [React Native: function components only, hooks for everything, no class components]
- [Flutter: stateless widgets where possible, state hoisted to provider/Riverpod]
- [Native iOS: Swift + SwiftUI; UIKit only when SwiftUI doesn't fit]

### TypeScript / language
- Strict mode. No `any`. Network responses typed at the boundary.

### Lists and performance
- Any list > 20 items uses virtualization (FlashList, FlatList with windowing, ListView.builder).
- Images explicitly sized; remote images go through a CDN with responsive variants.

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have accessibility labels.
- Color is never the only signal.
- Respects reduce-motion and large-text system settings.

### Testing
- Unit tests for stores, API wrappers, formatters, deep-link parsers.
- Component tests with rendering library (React Native Testing Library / Flutter widget tests).
- E2E (optional Phase 2): Detox / Maestro / Patrol.

### Distribution
- iOS build via [Expo EAS / fastlane / Xcode Cloud]; outputs ipa with provisioning profile.
- Android build outputs aab for Play Store.
- OTA-eligible changes: JS-only (no native module changes); enforced in PR checklist.

### Commits & Branches
- [conventional commits, branch naming]

### Environment Variables
- API endpoints (dev/staging/prod).
- Analytics keys, push provider keys.
- Feature flags resolved at app start.

## Writing tips

- **Screens are folders, not single files.** Once a screen has hooks + sub-components, splitting is mandatory.
- **API client wraps the network.** Direct fetch in components is the path to inconsistency.
- **Permissions need rationale UX.** Native prompts are unforgiving — soft-ask first.
- **OTA policy must be explicit.** Without it, native breakage will eventually be shipped via OTA.
