# PROJECT_STRUCTURE Template — Web API / backend service

Repo layout for a headless API or service. Adapt to chosen language/framework.

Target length: 200–300 lines.

## src/routes/ — Endpoint handlers

\`\`\`
[tree organized by resource: users/, organizations/, webhooks/, billing/, etc.]
\`\`\`

### Route conventions

- One file per resource. Routes are thin: validate input → call service → format response.
- No business logic in routes. If you're tempted, extract to `services/`.
- Every route has: input schema (Zod/Pydantic), service call, success response shape, error mapping.
- Auth/middleware composition is declarative at the file or route level.

## src/handlers/ — Webhook handlers

\`\`\`
[tree — one file per provider: stripe.ts, twilio.ts, github.ts]
\`\`\`

### Webhook conventions

- Signature verification happens in middleware before the handler runs.
- Dedup check (`webhook_events` table) before processing.
- Heavy work always queued; handler returns 2xx fast.
- Replay-safe: re-running a handler with the same event yields the same DB state.

## src/services/ — Domain logic

\`\`\`
[tree — one file per domain area: userService.ts, billingService.ts]
\`\`\`

### Service conventions

- Services orchestrate; they don't reach into HTTP or DB drivers directly.
- Services use repositories for data access and external clients (from `lib/`) for third-party calls.
- Services are tested in isolation with mocked repositories.

## src/repositories/ — Data access

\`\`\`
[tree — one file per table: usersRepo.ts, apiKeysRepo.ts]
\`\`\`

### Repository conventions

- One file per table or close-knit table group.
- Each function has a clear name describing the query (`findActiveKeysForOrg`, not `query`).
- Transactions are passed in; repos don't open them.

## src/schemas/ — Validation

\`\`\`
[tree — request/response schemas mirroring routes]
\`\`\`

- Schemas are reusable. Shared shapes live in `schemas/shared/`.
- Schemas double as TypeScript types via `z.infer<typeof X>` (or equivalent).

## src/middleware/

\`\`\`
[tree — auth.ts, rateLimit.ts, requestId.ts, errorHandler.ts]
\`\`\`

### Middleware conventions

- Auth middleware sets `req.context` (or equivalent) with `{ key, organizationId, scopes }`.
- Rate limit reads tier from auth context, applies bucket from store.
- Error handler is the single place that maps exceptions → HTTP status + body.

## src/workers/ — Background workers

\`\`\`
[tree if applicable — webhook delivery worker, async event processor]
\`\`\`

## migrations/

\`\`\`
[tree — timestamped migration files]
\`\`\`

### Migration conventions

- One concern per migration. No drive-by changes.
- Forward-only at MVP unless rollback is genuinely needed.
- Checked into the repo. Never edit applied migrations.

## Coding Conventions

### Language-specific
- [TypeScript: strict mode, no `any` in production code, Zod for I/O validation]
- [Python: type hints required, Pydantic for I/O, ruff/black]

### Auth and tenant context
- `req.context` is the only source of `organizationId`. Routes never trust query string for tenancy.
- Repositories accept `organizationId` explicitly; no hidden globals.

### Errors
- Domain errors are explicit classes (e.g. `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`).
- Routes don't catch — middleware does.
- Never leak stack traces in 5xx responses; log them, return generic message.

### Observability
- Every request gets a `request_id` (header in, propagated through logs and downstream calls).
- Logs are structured JSON. PII scrubbed at the boundary.

### Testing
- Unit tests for services with mocked repositories.
- Integration tests against a real local DB; routes hit through real HTTP.
- Webhook handlers tested with sample payloads + signature verification.

### Commits & Branches
- [conventional commits, branch naming]

### Environment Variables
- DB: `DATABASE_URL`.
- External providers: `STRIPE_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, etc.
- Feature flags: per-tier rate limits, beta endpoints.

## Writing tips

- **Routes are thin.** Anything beyond validation + service call + response formatting is misplaced.
- **Auth context is the only source of tenancy.** Anything else invites cross-tenant bugs.
- **Webhook processing always queues.** Handlers ack fast; workers do the work.
- **Migrations are immutable once applied.** Forward-only by default.
