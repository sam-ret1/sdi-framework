# Plan review protocol

Framework for reviewing an SDI implementation plan. The agent loaded with `sdi-review` runs the review itself by following the steps and checks below. No delegation — you are the reviewer.

This file is loaded by `sdi-review` for **Mode 1: plan review**. Other modes use `round-report-review-patterns.md`.

## Why this exists

A plan written by the same agent that scoped it tends to overstate readiness — the planner is not adversarial but wants to ship. An external review applies adversarial pressure: cross-checks every concrete claim against the repo, every choice against `DECISIONS.md`, every gate against evidenceability. The user typically runs this review across multiple sessions/models (e.g., Opus + Codex independently) to combine perspectives — each session loads this skill and runs the framework below.

## When this is used

- **First-pass plan review** — no prior findings; the plan is freshly written or revised.
- **Second-pass plan review** — prior findings exist; the planner revised the plan in response and the user wants the revisions checked.

## Setup

Before starting:

1. Identify the plan file path (typically `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_*.md`).
2. Identify the project's stack from `AGENTS.md` (one-line summary — frontend, backend, db, key services).
3. Identify the repo root (project directory containing `AGENTS.md`).
4. For a second-pass review, locate the prior review output (`docs/reviews/plan-review-NN.md`).

## Where the review goes

- **Output file** (committed for audit trail): `docs/reviews/plan-review-NN.md` where `NN` is the pass number, zero-padded (`01`, `02`, ...). If `docs/reviews/` doesn't exist, create it.
- For second-pass reviews, read `docs/reviews/plan-review-01.md` first and verify each prior finding was addressed in the plan revision. Save the second-pass review as `docs/reviews/plan-review-02.md`.

## Steps you must perform

1. Read the plan file end to end.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` (if exists) for stack, conventions, project facts.
3. Read `docs/PRD.md` (if exists).
4. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (if exists).
5. Read `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (if exists).
6. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` (if exists) — every prior decision binds the new plan.
7. Spot-check the actual repo (Glob/Grep/Read) for any concrete reference the plan makes (helpers, files, modules, env vars).
8. **[Second pass only]** Read `docs/reviews/plan-review-01.md` and verify each prior finding was addressed; flag dismissals without justification.

## Things you MUST actively check

A. **Internal consistency** — § X says one thing, § Y says another (numbers, names, behaviors, lifetimes, ordering of rounds, dates, counts).

B. **Plan-vs-repo grounding** — every reference to a file path / helper / env var / table / module name must exist in the repo or be created by the plan itself. Verify by Glob/Grep, not by trust.

C. **Plan-vs-DECISIONS** — every choice that overrides or contradicts a `DECISIONS.md` entry must be flagged.

D. **Plan-vs-PRD/ARCHITECTURE precedence** — PRD wins over plan; ARCHITECTURE wins over plan. Any plan choice that contradicts a higher-precedence doc is a finding.

E. **Missing prerequisites** — references components, hooks, env vars, tables, helpers, conventions that no prior phase delivered AND this plan doesn't create.

F. **Vague or non-binary gates** — gates a reviewer can't mark ✓/✗ from evidence. "Verify the integration tests pass" is too vague; "Integration test count matches plan §8 list and all pass per the runner output below" is binary.

G. **DECISIONS-worthy choices not flagged** — library choice, architecture pattern, scope deviation, accepted trade-off — must be called out as new `DECISIONS.md` entries in the plan. If the plan picks library X over Y without a `DECISIONS.md` entry, that's a finding.

H. **Stack-specific architecture mistakes** — wrong patterns for the project's stack. In-memory state in serverless, sync APIs in RSC, missing root layouts, RLS bypass, race conditions, unhandled promise rejections, ORM N+1, etc. Adapt the lens to the stack you read in `AGENTS.md`.

I. **Round structure soundness** — does each round's output enable the next? Are gates evidenceable from THAT round's deliverable, not a downstream one? Can each round be reviewed in isolation?

**[Second pass only]** J. **Resolution of prior findings** — for each finding in `plan-review-01.md`, does the plan fix it? Was a finding dismissed without reasoning? Did a fix introduce a NEW issue?

## Bug classes

1. Internal inconsistency.
2. Plan-vs-repo divergence.
3. Missing prerequisite.
4. Vague non-binary gate.
5. DECISIONS-worthy choice without flag.
6. Convention or architecture mistake.
7. Anything else surprising or risky.

## Output format

Findings-first. Do not summarize what works.

For each finding:
- **Class** (1–7).
- **Where** (§ + line region for plan; file:line for repo references).
- **What is wrong** (one sentence).
- **Why it bites** (one sentence).
- **Suggested fix** (one sentence).

End with TWO summary lines:
- `TOTAL FINDINGS: N. By class: 1=a, 2=b, 3=c, 4=d, 5=e, 6=f, 7=g.`
- `VERDICT: PASS / FAIL / ESCALATE.`

**VERDICT rules:** PASS only if zero findings of class 1–6. FAIL if there is at least one mechanically fixable finding in class 1–4 or 6. ESCALATE if there is at least one class-5 finding, a class-7 urgent risk, a scope/architecture conflict, or anything requiring user judgment. Non-urgent class 7 alone can remain PASS if it is only an advisory note.

## Saving the review

After writing the findings-first report (above format):

1. Save to `docs/reviews/plan-review-NN.md`.
2. Surface the report to the user in the conversation — don't make them open the file to read it. Lead with: "Saved to `docs/reviews/plan-review-NN.md`. Findings: N. Verdict: PASS/FAIL/ESCALATE. Top issues: [the 2-3 most material]."
3. Wait for user direction — accept findings, revise plan, request second pass.

## Iteration (second pass)

When the user revises the plan in response to first-pass findings and asks for re-review:

1. The planner agent (separate from this review session) edits the plan based on findings + user feedback.
2. Re-run this protocol with the second-pass branch active: also read `docs/reviews/plan-review-01.md` (step 8), and apply check J (resolution of prior findings).
3. Save output as `docs/reviews/plan-review-02.md`.

Cap iterations at 3 by convention. If the plan still has issues at pass 3, the structural problem isn't a review problem — escalate to the user.

## Common pitfalls

- **Trusting the plan's claims without verifying.** "We use the existing `useAuth` hook" — Grep for `useAuth` in the repo. If it doesn't exist or has a different shape, that's a finding (class 3).
- **Stopping at internal consistency.** Plans that are internally consistent but disagree with `AGENTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, or the actual repo are still wrong. Cross-check externally.
- **Treating "passes lint/typecheck" as approval.** A plan can be lint-clean and still wrong. The review is about correctness against the bundle, not syntax.
- **Rubber-stamping because the plan is well-written.** Style ≠ correctness. Polished plans can still have class-3 prerequisite holes or class-5 unflagged DECISIONS.
- **Inventing findings to look thorough.** If everything checks out, output zero findings and PASS. The discipline is honest verdicts, not productivity theater.
- **Skipping the saved artifact.** The saved file IS the audit trail. Future sessions read it; without it, the review is conversational only and disappears at session end.

## Note on running this in another model

The user may invoke this skill from a separate Codex session, a separate Opus session, or any other model. Each loads this skill and runs the same framework. The output (`docs/reviews/plan-review-NN.md`) is the same regardless of model — what differs is the model's blind spots. Combining 2-3 independent reviews of the same plan typically catches more than any single one alone.

If the user asks "how do I run a Codex review", point them to the Codex CLI documentation; this skill doesn't orchestrate that. The user's separate Codex session loads this skill the same way you did.
